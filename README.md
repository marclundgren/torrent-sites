torrent-sites
=============

Using the torrent network to host websites

This project is to explore the possibility of hosting websites entirely decentralised way. Hosted by people visiting the website.

I am very excited as i think its not far off now.

let talk about it here: https://github.com/marcus7777/torrent-sites/issues

What could torrent sites be used for?
* A free hard to block hosting plantform for all by all.
* A place for developers to work on projects that run locally and automatically sync with each other.

Things to add:
* A nice way edit the local storage.
* A way to authentication people and list people as okay to edit.
* A way of listing public site for people without a domain name.
